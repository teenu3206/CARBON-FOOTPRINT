History Of Carbon Footprint?
• The carbon footprint concept extends from "ecological 
footprints" by ecologist William Rees in the 1990s.
• It quantifies GHG emissions tied to organizations, events, 
products, or individuals. It gained prominence in 2005, 
notably through a BP media campaign.
Carbon Footprint 
• A carbon footprint represents the 
collective greenhouse gas emissions, 
both direct and indirect, associated 
with human activities.
• Typically, it's quantified in equivalent 
tons of carbon dioxide (CO2). This 
calculation typically covers a one-year 
timeframe.
Types Of Carbon Footprints
Include the emissions 
in making of a product 
(include only Direct 
emissions)
Include the emission in 
making as well as 
transport of product 
(include only Direct 
emissions)
Include the emission in 
procurement of raw 
materials, making and 
transport (include Direct 
and indirect emissions)

Calculation
If your car consumes 7.5 liter diesel per 100 km, then a Idrive of 300 
km distance consumes 3 x 7.5 = 22.5 liter - diesel, which adds 22.5 x 2.7 
kg = 60.75 kg CO2 to your personal carbon footprint.
Fuel Unit CO2 emitted per unit
Petrol 1 litter 2.3 kg
Gasoline 1 litter 2.3 kg
Diesel 1 litter 2.7 kg
Oil (heating) 1 litter 3.0 kg
Personal Carbon Footprint
Each of the following activities contributes 1 kg of CO2 to your personal carbon footprint:
• Travel by public transportation (train or bus) for a distance of 10 to 12 km (6.5 to 7 miles).
• Drive your car for a distance of 6 km or 3.75 miles (assuming 7.3 liters of petrol per 100 km or 39 
mpg).
• Take a 2.2 km or 1.375-mile flight.
• Operate your computer for 32 hours (assuming a 60 Watt consumption).
• The production of 5 plastic bags.
• The production of 2 plastic bottles.
• The production of 1/3 of an American cheeseburger.
Greenhouse gases are those that can 
absorb and emit infrared radiation. In 
order, the most abundant greenhouse 
gases in Earth's atmosphere are:

Main Effects
Depletion of Resources
Significant carbon footprints deplete resources on 
various scales, from deforestation on a national level to 
increased home air conditioning use. More significant 
footprints mean more greenhouse gases, intensifying 
climate change.
Climate Change
Climate change is the result of substantial carbon footprints, 
caused by natural and human-generated greenhouse gases. 
Between 1990-2005, CO2 emissions increased by 31%, 
leading to a 35% rise in radiative warming by 2008. Large 
carbon footprints also deplete resources.

Conclusion 
Reducing our carbon footprint is essential for a sustainable future. 
Each small effort, collectively, makes a significant impact in 
combating climate change and preserving our planet
